# Demo Stack

A demo for a Polyglot Vancouver presentation on application monitoring.

## Abstract

Monitoring is important, as you can't manage what you haven't
measured. Rule of thumb; if it moves graph it, if it's critical alert
on it (actionable). There are several ways an application can emit and
expose the data that we as developers and operators care about, the
most common methods being log streams and instrumentation. Logs can be
a treasure trove of information, usually *lightly structured, full of
metrics, performance and usage indicators. Software instrumentation is
a necessary evil to provide a way to measure what code does when it
runs, in production. Knowing application dependencies, understanding
their relationships, and monitoring all the way down to the system
resources they consume is a MUST. Nothing beats a functional
check. There is not one tool to rule them all, think unix toolchain.

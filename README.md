# Demo Stack

A demo for a Polyglot Vancouver presentation on application monitoring.

## Abstract

Monitoring is important, as you can't manage what you haven't
measured. Rule of thumb; if it moves graph it, if it's critical alert
on it. There are several ways an application can emit and expose the
data that we as developers and operators care about, the most common
methods being log streams and instrumentation. Logs can be a tresure
trove of information, usually *lightly stuctured, full of metrics,
performance and usage indicators. Software instrumentation is a
necessary evil to provide a way to measure what code does when it
runs, in production.
